Python-Powered Fantasy Football Analytics Engine üèàüêç

Python may have saved my Fantasy Football League ‚Äî and it can showcase the kind of data-driven problem-solving I love to build.

After noticing that ESPN projections were consistently off, leaving my highest scoring players on the bench, I decided to take control with data. The result: a Python engine that combines statistical rigor, domain knowledge, and automation to optimize fantasy football decisions.

What This Engine Does

Baseline Score Calculation

Uses historical weekly performance data from this and previous seasons.

Establishes a "floor" expectation for each player, helping avoid surprises.

Opponent-Adjusted Projections

Considers the opposing team‚Äôs defensive rankings against each position.

Factors in Vegas spreads and predicted game outcomes.

Implements football logic to adjust for high-scoring opportunities and match-up advantages.

Injury Impact Modeling

Automatically adjusts projections for players affected by injuries.

Boosts secondary or replacement players to reflect likely game-time opportunities.

Roster and Waiver Wire Analysis

Pulls real-time roster percentages using the ESPN API.

Identifies optimal waiver wire pickups per position (QB, RB, WR, TE).

Highlights high-upside players under 35% rostered for strategic acquisitions.

Google Sheets Integration

Automatically exports projections and recommendations to Google Sheets.

Highlights players by expected overperformance/underperformance with color gradients.

Separates each position into its own sheet for easy decision-making.

Technical Highlights

Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, gspread, gspread-formatting, espn-api, re

Data Handling: Joins historical data, current season stats, and live roster percentages.

Automation: Single pipeline to fetch, process, rank, and output actionable recommendations.

Visualization: Conditional formatting in Google Sheets for quick insights.

Example Workflow

Pull weekly projections CSV.

Normalize player names and merge historical performance.

Calculate baseline and projected points for each player.

Adjust for injuries and opponent match-ups.

Add rostered percentages for all players.

Generate positional recommendations for waiver wire pickups.

Export results to Google Sheets with color-coded highlights for actionable insights.

Impact

Transformed subjective fantasy football decision-making into a data-driven strategy.

Identified high-upside players overlooked by ESPN.

Provided a competitive edge in weekly line-up selection through automation and analytics.

Key Takeaways

Combining data science + domain knowledge + automation can create a tangible advantage, even in fantasy sports.

Python and APIs can turn disparate sources of data into actionable recommendations.

Small improvements in projection accuracy and player selection strategy can significantly impact outcomes.
